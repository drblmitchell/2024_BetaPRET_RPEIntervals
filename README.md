# Effect of β-blockade on measures and reproducibility of heart rate, oxygen uptake and work rate across repeated bouts of short-duration, RPE-regulated exercise

This repository contains the R code and associated environment for the statistical analyses conducted in a study examining the influence of β-blockade on heart rate, oxygen uptake, and work rate during repeated bouts of short-duration, RPE-regulated exercise. The study also evaluated the reproducibility of these physiological measures under different conditions.
